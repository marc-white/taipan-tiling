    """
    Compute updates to science types, priorities & difficulties and
    re-insert into DB.
    Moving this all into a single method prevents unnecessary duplication
    of DB reads/writes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cursor : psycopg2.connection.cursor object
    target_list : list of ints
        List of target IDs to consider. Defaults to None, at which point all
        targets will be considered.
    field_list : list of ints
        List of field_ids to consider. Defaults to None, at which point all
        fields will be considered. If both target_list and field_list are
        supplied, field_list will be ignored.
    do_tp : Boolean, defaults to True
        Boolean denoting whether to compute types & priorities (True) or not
        (False). Defaults to True.
    do_d
        Boolean denoting whether to compute difficulties1 (True) or not
        (False). Defaults to True.
    priority_function : function
        Function to be used to compute the target priorities.
        The default function is
        :any:`taipan.simulate.logic.compute_target_priorities_tree`; this
        should only need to be changed at runtime for more specific testing,
        e.g. science commissioning with specialized target catalogues.

    Returns
    -------
    Nil. Database is updated in place.
